Credit Score Model
Project Overview

The Credit Score Prediction System is designed to predict an individual's creditworthiness using historical financial data. The system leverages machine learning techniques to classify individuals as low or high credit risk, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions.

Objective

Predict an individual's creditworthiness based on past financial behavior.

Provide insights into key factors affecting credit risk.

Demonstrate machine learning applications in finance.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and formats financial datasets for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Generates meaningful features from historical financial data.

Machine Learning Models: Implements classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

Evaluation Metrics: Uses Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.

Visualizations: Displays insights like credit risk distribution and age-wise risk trends.

Dataset

The dataset includes the following features (non-exhaustive):

Personal information: Age, Gender, Marital Status

Financial data: Credit amount, Payment history, Savings, Debts

Risk classification: Credit Risk (Good/Bad)
